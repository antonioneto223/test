This project is part of the Data Challenge test. 

dbt was used for the ETL connected with BigQuerry database (as the trial/free version of GCP under the same account: antonio.neto223@gmail.com).

The source CSV was uploaded to BigQuerry and then accessed in dbt for the dimensional model construction. Then, Power BI was connected to the BigQuerry database in order to create visual analyses / dashboards using the tables created in the dimensional model. The Power BI file was uploaded to this Github repo. Additionally, a PDF presentation containing the summaried steps applied in the solution was also uploaded in the repo main folder.

For further questions, the code owner can be contacted in the above-mentioned email.
